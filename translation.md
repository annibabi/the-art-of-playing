the art of playing
Bryan Tanaman

Ah playing is such fun
As the author George Bernard Shaw once said: you don’t stop playing because you are old, you grow old because you stop playing.
We all know that children love to play, and not only children.
During childhood and adolescence, the brain and ???? just get the most significant development.
Since the dawn of history, people acknowledged this fact using games to sharpen children’s mind and skills which they can do with the real life situation.
Teachers would draw lines in the sand and their pupils will play pebbles.
Families will spend long evenings around the table absorbed in the pleasure and challenge of playing games.
Generals learn battles’ strategies through playing chess.
And Japanese SAMURAI understood the importance of mind games
and adopting the game Go as one of the seven most important martial arts.
A great deal of knowledge has been lost since then and lifestyle have changed.

violent action games, extreme video clips and hours spent in front of computer have  replaced the experience of sitting in company around the game’s table.
Where is the toll?? ever persevering together in this? 
A sad reality indeed.
But apparently not all our hope is lost.
Would you believe that currently more than two million children in thirty countries around the world play games, doing lessons in class and with the teacher’s permission
 
One of the current trends in education is to teach children how to think.
The mind lab method promotes development thought in a very unique manner through play.
“My favorite game in mind lab is ... knew in Look out？？？, this game helps me to solve the problems.”

So this is what it looks like. Interesting, isn’t it? But what’s the method behind it?

At the heart of the method is the notion that children’s experience while playing will be both enjoyable and fascinating, so that they would be more and more motivated to engage in what end up in depth learning.

The learning process actually involves three primary stages:
In the first stage, the children learn games and play them in teams.
This is the stage in which the teacher enters the picture and they actually provide them with the toolbox for implementing thought strategy and thought concepts.

“Very good, so now you know that’s her plan. The question is can you do anything to prevent it.”

In the second stage, the children and the teacher discuss together what they’ve managed to learn through the game itself and they apply the models to the lessons learned.

The core of the system is the models and every model has its implications, from the game into the life itself.
when they group all my pieces together and i advance them on the board as one group rather than individually, then other groups they have much more power.
In this way i have a lot more options.
 
Could one bird fly across the ocean on their own?
eh no, i don’t think so.
but if they work together, they can, can’t they?

in the third step
we will teach the children how to make a transposition, a transposition of what they’ve learned through play models to real life.
when they actually encounter challenges and situations will be able to perform better through the models.

i want to teach you a decision making model
this model is intended for analyzing the environment in a better manner when facing rivals
for example, when you get upset to a kid or when someone makes you mad 
red means you should calm down now or you stop and think.

very good, well done
for example, if i would play football outside and smaller kids were playing and kick the ball, which would then hit my head 
I should first calm down, stop and examine what their goal was
why do they do this
examine the environment 
after examining the environment 
i prepare to act
if i see that it is not intentional
i calm down as you said 
and now i am walking after having a few seconds to think things over.

the mind lab method is the bridge that connects the world of games with the real world
the method includes the educational programs that are given toward children and teenagers age 4 to 16
the program in cooperate with a wide range of courses
that are aimed at improving upon children’s thinking skills by addressing cognitive, social and emotional issues
 
i like the games because it is completely different to others games you can play
they teach things which i find fun

all this is fine
There is no doubt that for the children playing is fun 
but who says it works?
how do we know that the method is really effective?
and manages to influence children’s mental behavioral patterns?

... leading researchers from..perstitul universities around the world had brought by professor Donald Green of Yale University in the United States have examined this

with that three and a half years i’ve conducted to the serials of scientific evaluations of the mind lab curriculum
in the treatment group
children receive the mind lab curriculum whereby they play with games but learn broader lessons about the applicability of the strategic concepts to other arrays of life
and in the control group
they simply play with games 
and what we find is a significant improvement in the treatment group

when these children were tested in math and verbal ability
it was found that the treatment group significantly outperform to the control group

the more exposure children have to the mind lab curriculum, the more intensively it is implemented, the best they do
and in a field where real interventions the work are ??? rare
I’m quite pleased to report that this is one of those innovations that does work
it works to a high standard of scientific equability  

i think it is time to get to know the people behind the vision
 
the development team whose members have being working together for thirteen years is made of educators from a variety of specializations and people from the world of games, including players of chess, Go and bridge

i was a very poor math student when i was a kid
which was kind of surprising with the fact that i was very strong at games, especially chess

we created this company on the bases of our childhood experiences
when we played this as kids and later on the students
we learned a lot
it was actually this understanding that playing is so helpful that made us create this company

the game helped me a lot to overcome the problem i had in school 
and that gave me a lot of motivation to try and help other kids with the same problem

Matan Toledo, a twelve year old from ??? studied in six grade
until fifth grade 
he was considered as a weak student
he was not good in physics or math  
and his capabilities were considered bellow average
because of this, he suffered from low self esteem 
and his social relation suffered  

i achieve the best scores in thinking games
he came with this news I won in class 
in the entire grade and the entire school
 
the teachers in school discovered another side to his personality
...... the achievement tease motivate to study

i improved in subjects like Bible studies, history, geography

our advantages is that we have created the program based on a few experiences with kids rather than a few radical plan to be implemented later on

it was evident that the self confident he started to display and even in the way his friends related to him 

and then suddenly i felt better about myself
like i could really be a winner

There is no doubt that this is a success story 
the method is really proving itself in thousands of schools 
across thirty countries
on all five continents
and every three weeks 
another country joins them

in the last three years i’ve been visiting over twenty countries 
and very quickly i came to the conclusion that people are people and kids are kids
They behave and respond to the program pretty much the same way
whether they are from Brazil, Australia or Japan 

it taught me so much 
And i felt so much better than school

So it’s helping him to think logically basically into everyday problems in life 
and it really is helping out
 
when they talk about using ..???.against parents
i think it is better around..
so it is some kind of fun

eh, i love i love games
and i even play with my mom and dad at home

and i’ve make a lot of friends here

i really like the mind lab games because it was like so much fun

the research in development team of mind lab routinely create new and exciting educational and visual tools 
use over one hundred thinking games
both modern and classic from all over the world

we developed and extended serials of textbooks and workbooks for all age groups
as well as innovated educational software packages and many demonstration of self use utility
to help educational team around the world employ the method
we train them and support them all the way

nowadays in the age of the internet and computer games 
children get to school when they want to play together 
and not just during the break
they want to play together the way we did as the kids

what i do is i walk along the corridors sometimes when i look through the windows 
and you see that they are really engaged, they are interested
and they are very happy 
that is what we want them to be at the school 
they can really gain from it intellectually and this is go to give them some skills for life
 
a kid, once he has self-confident will act 
once he has the decision making 
and problem-solving tools 
the products will be better 
in fact educational systems throughout the world should have this tool 

the kids love it 
parents love the program
teachers enjoy when they teach it
and that ends in a completely universal 

Mind lab is so fun

well we discuss the unique significance of mind games on the educational process 
and we have discovered the group people
who develop a unique educational process based on these games 
i found it fascinating 
as the philosophy Plato sum it up precisely:
Not by fault shall the children learn 
but by play 

education is child’s play

游戏的艺术

啊～游戏是如此的充满乐趣
作家Oliver Wendell Holmes曾经说过
我们不是因为年老而停止玩乐
我们是因为停止玩乐才会变老
众所周知 孩子们都爱玩游戏
实际上 不仅仅是孩子才爱玩

在儿童与青少年时期
大脑经历最重要的发展阶段
从很久以前
人们就知道利用游戏
来锻炼孩子们
处理真实生活情境的思维和技能
老师在沙子上画线条
学生们就玩鹅卵石
在家里，大家整晚围坐在桌边
沉浸在玩游戏的挑战和乐趣中
将军们从国际象棋中学习战术
连日本武士也认识到思维游戏的重要性
他们将围棋作为七大最重要的武术之一
但在那之后，大量的知识流失了
生活方式也改变了

暴力动作游戏，尤其是视频游戏
和大量花费在电脑前的时间
取代了
与伙伴们一起围坐游戏桌前玩游戏的时光
曾经的乐趣在哪里？
这真是一个可悲的现实
但显然，我们的希望并没有完全失去
目前，全世界有30多个国家
200多万的孩子得到了老师的允许
在课堂上玩游戏学习
你相信吗？

以色列布里迪斯学校校长 Zafi Michael
当前教育的一个趋势是教孩子们如何思考
麦博思维实验室的方法
正是利用游戏这种独特的方式
来促进思维的发展

在麦博思维实验室中
我最喜欢的一个游戏是太空人
这个游戏可以帮助我解决问题

这就是麦博思维实验室
很有趣，对吧？
那么这背后的原理又是什么呢？

麦博思维实验室培训经理 Livna Grinbaum
这个方法的核心是这样一个概念
如果孩子们
可以通过愉快的、迷人的游戏来获得经验
他们就会越来越积极地
参与到最终的深入学习中

学习过程实际上包括三个主要阶段
第一阶段
孩子们学习游戏，然后分组玩游戏
这是老师将孩子们带入游戏的阶段
他们实际上为孩子们提供了
实施思维策略和思维概念的工具箱

非常好
现在你知道那是她的计划
问题是你有什么办法来阻止它

第二阶段
孩子们和老师一起讨论
他们通过游戏本身学到了什么
然后他们将学到的模式应用在课堂上

麦博思维实验室培训师 Mor Yahel
这个系统的核心就是这些模式
而无论是在游戏中，还是到生活中
每一个模式都有它自己的意义

当他们把我所有的碎片整合起来
而我把这些作为一个整体
而不是一个个个体
在黑板上推进
这样其他组就有更多的力量
这样我就有更多的选择

一只鸟能独自飞越海洋再飞回来吗？
不，我想不行
但是如果它们集体努力呢？是可以的，对吗？
对

在第三阶段
我们将教给孩子们如何迁移
就是将他们在游戏中学到的
通过模式迁移到现实生活中
当他们真正面对挑战和状况时
他们能够利用模式
处理的更好

我想要教大家一个决策模式
这个模式是为了
在面对对手时更好的分析环境
比方说
当你对一个孩子生气
或者有人让你抓狂时
红灯意味着你应该冷静下来
或者说，停下来思考

非常好，棒极了
举个例子
当我在外面踢足球
比我小的孩子也在玩
他们踢球时球砸到了我的脑袋
首先我应该冷静下来
停下来想一想
他这样做的目的是什么
为什么他要那样做
检查一下周围的环境
然后再准备行动
如果我发现他们不是故意的
我会平静下来，就像你说的
几秒钟之后，我会努力的想
已经没事了

麦博思维实验室的方法
是连接游戏世界和现实世界的桥梁
它包括了适用于4至16岁的
儿童与青少年的教育项目
项目配套有丰富的课程
主要针对社会、认知和情绪方面的问题
来提高儿童的思维能力

我喜欢这些游戏
因为它们和我以前玩的游戏
完全不一样
它们教给我一些我觉得很有趣的事情

这一切都很好
毫无疑问
对孩子们来说，玩是很有趣的
但是谁说它行得通？
我们怎么知道这个方法真的有效？
我们怎么知道它是否真的可以
影响孩子们的思维和行为模式？

由美国耶鲁大学Don Green教授带领的
世界各地大学的顶尖研究人员
对此做了实验

欢迎来到耶鲁大学

我们用了三年半的时间
做了一系列
关于麦博思维实验室的科学评估
在实验组里
孩子们接受麦博思维实验室的课程
他们玩游戏，学习更广泛的课程
并且学习将策略概念运用到生活中
而在控制组
孩子们只是单纯玩游戏
结果我们发现，相比控制组
实验组有着非常显著的提高

当这些孩子们接受数学和言语能力测试时
实验组的表现明显优于控制组

实验对象接受的课程强度越深，范围越大
他们的表现就越好
在这一领域，介入有效相对而言是很罕见的
但我可以很高兴的说
麦博思维实验室的课程介入确实起作用
从科学可信度来看
课程的可信度达到高水平

我觉得 是时候让大家认识一下
这个项目的幕后团队了

麦博思维实验室研发团队的成员们
已经在一起工作了十三年
他们由来自各领域的教育专家
和世界各地的桥牌
国际象棋和围棋高手组成

麦博思维实验室创始人 Ehud Shachar
我小时候数学很差
但是我发现玩游戏是我的强项
尤其是国际象棋

麦博思维实验室创始人 Dan Gendelman
我们正是基于自己的童年经历
创立这家公司的
在孩童和学生时代
我们从玩游戏中学到了很多东西
事实上
正是意识到玩游戏是如此有用
才促使我们创立了这家公司

游戏让我克服了我在学校面临的问题
这给了我想要去帮助
其他拥有同样问题的孩子的动机

Matan Toledo
12岁，正上六年级
直到五年级
他都被认为是一个差生
他的物理和数学成绩都不好
学习能力被认为是低于平均水平
由于这些，他非常不自信
与周围同学的关系也不好
 
接触到思维游戏之后
他一步一步从最后一名到班级第一
到年级第一，到全校第一
Matan Toledo的父亲

Matan的老师 Shmuela regev
通过游戏我们发现了他性格中的另一面
找到了他成绩提高的动力

我的圣经学习、历史、地理成绩都提高了

我们的优势在于
我们基于孩子的实践课堂经验
来研发学习项目
而不仅仅是建立在理论上

由于自信心增加
他开始表现自我
跟同学的关系也大有改善

突然间 我的自我感觉很棒
我相信我也可以成为一个赢家

毫无疑问，这是个成功的案例
这个项目已经在全球30多个国家和地区的
上千所学校得到了证实
而且每三个星期
就有新的国家新的学校加入到这个队列中

麦博思维实验室市场部经理 Tzvika Feldfogel
在过去三年中
我在二十多个国家推广这个项目
很快我就得出这样一个结论
虽然民族不同 研究对象不同
但是人类的行为方式和反应方式是很相似的
无论他们是巴西人、澳大利亚人还是日本人

这个项目教给我很多东西
让我在学校进步很快

它教会孩子有逻辑地、从根本上
来考虑日常生活中的问题
的确帮助很大

说到效果 他排名提高了不少
我为他感到骄傲

我很喜欢这些游戏
我甚至在家里和爸爸妈妈玩

我在这儿交到了很多朋友

我太喜欢麦博思维实验室了
因为它太有趣了

麦博思维实验室的研发团队
利用全球百余种经典的和现代的思维游戏
定期开发出新的、个性化的
教学和视觉游戏

我们还开发和扩展了一系列
适用于各个年龄层的教材和游戏手册
以及个性化的教学软件包
各类示范教学材料和用具
为了帮助世界各地的教学团队
来参与这个项目
我们会从头到尾不间断地
以各种方式培训和支持他们

在现在这个互联网和电脑游戏的时代
孩子们到学校来就是想和朋友们一起玩 
而且不止是在课间休息时间
他们想要像我们童年时那样
跟同龄人一起玩游戏

英格兰 Sonning Common学校校长 Phillip Marples
我所做的就是
有时当我在走廊上经过
我透过窗户看向教室
你会发现孩子们真的很投入
他们喜欢这些游戏
他们玩得 学得很快乐
那正是我们所希望的
孩子们在学校里的样子
他们在游戏中互动学习
这些游戏教会他们一些
在将来实际生活中非常有用的技能

任何一个孩子
只要他有自信 就会去行动
只要他有做决定和解决问题的能力
他就能成为一个有用的人才
实际上
全球的教育机构都应该采用
这个游戏教学工具

孩子们喜欢它
家长也欢迎这样的教学项目
教师们很享受这样的教学过程
这是一种全新的感受

麦博思维实验室太有趣了

好了
我们谈论了思维游戏
在教学过程中的独特意义
也了解了这群利用这些游戏
开发出这样一种
独一无二与众不同的教学方式的人
这真是太棒了
正如古希腊哲学家柏拉图所做的精确概括
不要强迫孩子们学习
应该通过游戏让他们学到知识

教育是孩子的游戏
