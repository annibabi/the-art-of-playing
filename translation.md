the art of playing
Bryan Tanaman

Ah playing is such fun
As the author George Bernard Shaw once said: you don’t stop playing because you are old, you grow old because you stop playing.
We all know that children love to play, and not only children.
During childhood and adolescence, the brain and ???? just get the most significant development.
Since the dawn of history, people acknowledged this fact using games to sharpen children’s mind and skills which they can do with the real life situation.
Teachers would draw lines in the sand and their pupils will play pebbles.
Families will spend long evenings around the table absorbed in the pleasure and challenge of playing games.
Generals learn battles’ strategies through playing chess.
And Japanese SAMURAI understood the importance of mind games
and adopting the game Go as one of the seven most important martial arts.
A great deal of knowledge has been lost since then and lifestyle have changed.

violent action games, extreme video clips and hours spent in front of computer have  replaced the experience of sitting in company around the game’s table.
Where is the toll?? ever persevering together in this? 
A sad reality indeed.
But apparently not all our hope is lost.
Would you believe that currently more than two million children in thirty countries around the world play games, doing lessons in class and with the teacher’s permission
 
One of the current trends in education is to teach children how to think.
The mind lab method promotes development thought in a very unique manner through play.
“My favorite game in mind lab is ... knew in Look out？？？, this game helps me to solve the problems.”

So this is what it looks like. Interesting, isn’t it? But what’s the method behind it?

At the heart of the method is the notion that children’s experience while playing will be both enjoyable and fascinating, so that they would be more and more motivated to engage in what end up in depth learning.

The learning process actually involves three primary stages:
In the first stage, the children learn games and play them in teams.
This is the stage in which the teacher enters the picture and they actually provide them with the toolbox for implementing thought strategy and thought concepts.

“Very good, so now you know that’s her plan. The question is can you do anything to prevent it.”

In the second stage, the children and the teacher discuss together what they’ve managed to learn through the game itself and they apply the models to the lessons learned.

The core of the system is the models and every model has its implications, from the game into the life itself.
when they group all my pieces together and i advance them on the board as one group rather than individually, then other groups they have much more power.
In this way i have a lot more options.
 
Could one bird fly across the ocean on their own?
eh no, i don’t think so.
but if they work together, they can, can’t they?

in the third step
we will teach the children how to make a transposition, a transposition of what they’ve learned through play models to real life.
when they actually encounter challenges and situations will be able to perform better through the models.

i want to teach you a decision making model
this model is intended for analyzing the environment in a better manner when facing rivals
for example, when you get upset to a kid or when someone makes you mad 
red means you should calm down now or you stop and think.

very good, well done
for example, if i would play football outside and smaller kids were playing and kick the ball, which would then hit my head 
I should first calm down, stop and examine what their goal was
why do they do this
examine the environment 
after examining the environment 
i prepare to act
if i see that it is not intentional
i calm down as you said 
and now i am walking after having a few seconds to think things over.

the mind lab method is the bridge that connects the world of games with the real world
the method includes the educational programs that are given toward children and teenagers age 4 to 16
the program in cooperate with a wide range of courses
that are aimed at improving upon children’s thinking skills by addressing cognitive, social and emotional issues
 
i like the games because it is completely different to others games you can play
they teach things which i find fun

all this is fine
There is no doubt that for the children playing is fun 
but who says it works?
how do we know that the method is really effective?
and manages to influence children’s mental behavioral patterns?

... leading researchers from..perstitul universities around the world had brought by professor Donald Green of Yale University in the United States have examined this

with that three and a half years i’ve conducted to the serials of scientific evaluations of the mind lab curriculum
in the treatment group
children receive the mind lab curriculum whereby the play with games but learn broader lessons about the applicability of the strategic concepts to other arrays of life
and in the control group
they simply play with games 
and what we find is a significant improvement in the treatment group

when these children were tested in math and verbal ability
it was found that the treatment group significantly outperform to the control group

the more exposure children have to the mind lab curriculum, the more intensively it is implemented, the best they do
and in a field where real interventions the work are???
I’m quite pleased to report that this is one of those innovations that does work
it works to a high standard of scientific equability  

i think it is time to get to know the people behind the vision
 
the development team whose members have being working together for thirteen years is made of educators from a variety of specializations and people from the world of games, including players of chess, Go and bridge

i was a very poor math student when i was a kid
which was kind of surprising with the fact that i was very strong at games, especially chess

we created this company on the bases of our childhood experiences
when we played this as kids and later on the students
we learned a lot
it was actually this understanding that playing is so helpful that made us create this company

the game helped me a lot to overcome the problem i had in school 
and that gave me a lot of motivation to try and help other kids with the same problem

Matan Toledo, a twelve year old from ??? studied in six grade
until fifth grade 
he was considered as a weak student
he was not good in physics or math  
and his capabilities were considered bellow average
because of this, he suffered from low self esteem 
and his social relation suffered  

i achieve the best scores in thinking games
he came with this news I won in class 
in the entire grade and the entire school
 
the teachers in school discovered another side to his personality
...... the achievement tease motivate to study

i improved in subjects like Bible studies, history, geography

our advantages is that we have created the program based on a few experiences with kids rather than a few radical plan to be implemented later on

it was evident that the self confident he started to display and even in the way his friends related to him 

and then suddenly i felt better about myself
like i could really be a winner

There is no doubt that this is a success story 
the method is really proving itself in thousands of schools 
across thirty countries
on all five continents
and every three weeks 
another country joins them

in the last three years i’ve been visiting over twenty countries 
and very quickly i came to the conclusion that people are people and kids are kids
They behave and respond to the program pretty much the same way
whether they are from Brazil, Australia or Japan 

it taught me so much 
And i felt so much better than school

So it’s helping him to think logically basically into everyday problems in life 
and it really is helping out
 
when they talk about using ..???.against parents
i think it is better around..
so it is some kind of fun

eh, i love i love games
and i even play with my mom and dad at home

and i’ve make a lot of friends here

i really like the mind lab games because it was like so much fun

the research in development team of mind lab routinely create new and exciting educational and visual tools 
use over one hundred thinking games
both modern and classic from all over the world

we developed and extended serials of textbooks and workbooks for all age groups
as well as innovated educational software packages and many demonstration of self use utility
to help educational team around the world employ the method
we train them and support them all the way

nowadays in the age of the internet and computer games 
children get to school when they want to play together 
and not just during the break
they want to play together the way we did as the kids

what i do is i walk along the corridors sometimes when i look through the windows 
and you see that they are really engaged, they are interested
and they are very happy 
that is what we want them to be at the school 
they can really gain from it intellectually and this is go to give them some skills for life
 
a kid, once he has self-confident will act 
once he has the decision making 
and problem-solving tools 
the products will be better 
in fact educational systems throughout the world should have this tool 

the kids love it 
parents love the program
teachers enjoy when they teach it
and that ends in a completely universal 

Mind lab is so fun

well we discuss the unique significance of mind games on the educational process 
and we have discovered the group people
who develop a unique educational process based on these games 
i found it fascinating 
as the philosophy Plato sum it up precisely:
Not by fault shall the children learn 
but by play 

education is child’s play

游戏的艺术

啊～玩耍是多么有趣啊
萧伯纳？？曾经说过
我们不是因为年老而停止玩乐
我们是因为停止玩乐才会变老
我们都知道孩子们爱玩
而且不仅仅是孩子才爱玩

在儿童与青少年时期
大脑和？？？迎来了最显著的一次发展
从很久以前
人们就知道利用游戏
来锻炼孩子们
处理真实生活情境的思维和技能
老师在沙子上画线条
学生们就玩鹅卵石
在家里，大家整晚围坐在桌边
沉浸在游戏的挑战和乐趣中
将军们从国际象棋中学习战术
连日本武士也知道思维游戏的重要性
他们将围棋作为七大最重要的武术之一
但在那之后，大量的知识流失了
生活方式也改变了

？？动作游戏，尤其是视频游戏
和大量花费在电脑前的时间
取代了
与伙伴们一起围坐游戏桌前玩游戏的时光
？？？曾经的上课铃声在哪里？
真是一个悲伤的现实
但显然，我们的希望并没有完全失去
目前，在30多个国家
有200多万孩子们在课堂上玩游戏
并且有老师的批准
你相信吗？

当前教育的一个趋势是教孩子们如何思考
麦博思维实验室的方法
正是利用游戏这种独特的方式
来促进思想的发展

在麦博思维实验室中
我最喜欢的一个游戏是？？？
这个游戏可以帮助我解决问题

这就是麦博思维实验室
很有趣，不是吗？
那么这背后的原理又是什么呢？

这个方法的核心是这样一个概念
如果孩子们
通过愉快的、迷人的游戏来获得经验
他们就会越来越积极地
参与到最终的深入学习中

学习过程实际上包括三个主要阶段
第一阶段
孩子们学习游戏，并在团队中玩
这是老师将孩子们带入游戏的阶段
他们实际上为孩子们提供了
实施思维策略和思维概念的工具箱

非常好
现在你知道那是她的计划
问题是你能不能做一些事来阻止它

第二阶段
孩子们和老师一起讨论
他们通过游戏本身学到了什么
然后他们将这些模型应用在课堂上

这个系统的核心就是这些模型
而无论是在游戏中，还是到生活中
每一个模型都有它自己的意义

当他们把我所有的碎片整合起来
而我把这些作为一个整体
而不是一个个个体，
在黑板上推进
这样其他组就有更多的力量
这样我就有更多的选择

一只鸟能独自飞越海洋吗？
不，我不认为它可以。
但是如果它们一起合作，是可以的，对吗？

在第三阶段
我们将教给孩子们如何迁移
就是将他们在游戏中学到的
通过模型迁移到真实的生活中
当他们真正面对挑战和状况时
他们能够利用模型
处理的更好

我想要教给你们一个决策模型
这个模型是为了
在面对对手时更好的分析环境
比方说
当你对一个孩子生气
或者有人让你抓狂时
红灯意味着你应该冷静下来
或者说，停下来思考

非常好，棒极了
举个例子
如果我在外面踢足球
更小的孩子也在玩
他们踢球时球砸到了我的脑袋
我应该先冷静下来
停下来看看他们的目标是什么
为什么他们这样做
看看环境
在分析了环境之后
我再准备采取行动
如果我发现这不是故意的
我就冷静下来，就像你说的
然后我就这样让这件事过去

麦博思维实验室的方法
是连接游戏世界和现实世界的桥梁
它包括了针对4至16岁的
儿童与青少年的教育方案
方案搭配有各种各样的
针对社会、认知和情绪问题来
提高儿童思维能力的课程

我喜欢这些游戏
因为它们和你能玩的别的游戏
完全不一样
它们教给我一些我觉得很有趣的事情

所有这些都很好
毫无疑问
对孩子们来说，玩是很有趣的
但是谁说它行得通？
我们怎么知道这个方法真的有效？
我们怎么知道它可以
影响孩子们的思维和行为模式？

由美国耶鲁大学唐纳德格林教授带领的
世界各地大学的顶尖研究人员
对此做了实验

我们用了三年半的时间
做了一系列
关于麦博思维实验室的科学评估
在实验组
孩子们接受麦博思维实验室的课程
玩游戏的同时
学习将策略概念运用到生活中
而在控制组
孩子们只是单纯玩游戏
我们发现实验组有非常显著的进步

当这些孩子们接受数学和言语能力测试时
我们发现实验组的表现明显优于控制组

孩子们接受的课程越多、越密集
他们的表现就越好
在一个干预工作的领域
我很高兴的报告
这是一个确实行之有效的创新方法
它符合科学的高标准

我觉得是时候让大家了解一下
这个东西背后的人了

麦博思维实验室研发团队的成员们
在一起工作了十三年
他们是一群来自各种专业的教育学家
和来自游戏世界的大师们
包括国际象棋、围棋和桥牌大师

我以前是一个数学很差的孩子
所以当我发现自己玩游戏
特别是国际象棋很厉害时非常吃惊

我们正是基于自己的童年经历
创立了这家公司
在孩童和学生时代
我们从玩游戏中学到了很多东西
事实上
正是因为理解了玩游戏是如此有益
促使我们创建了这家公司

在克服我在学校的问题中
游戏帮助了我很多
这给了我想要去帮助
其他拥有同样问题的孩子的动机

马坦·多雷多
来自？？？，12岁，正上六年级
直到五年级
他都被认为是一个差生
他的物理和数学不好
能力被认为低于平均水平
因为这一点，他非常不自信
社会功能也受到了影响

我在思维游戏中得了最高分
他把这个消息带回来
在班里，在全年级，在全校赢了

学校的老师们发现了他性格中的另一面
这个成绩激励了他的学习

我的圣经学习、历史、地理成绩提高了

我们的优势是
我们依据孩子的经验来建立学习方案
而不是建立在后期实施的一些激进计划上

他开始明显地变得自信
甚至在与朋友的互动中也表现得更好

我突然自我感觉很棒
就好像我真的可以成为一个赢家

毫无疑问，这是一个成功故事
这个方法已经在上千所学校得到了证明
跨越五大洲的30个国家
而每三个星期
就有另一个国家也加入到这个队列中

过去三年来
我访问了二十多个国家
很快我就得出这样一个结论
大人是大人，孩子是孩子
他们对这个学习方案的反应和表现
几乎都是一样的
无论他们来自巴西、澳大利亚还是日本

它教了我太多东西
比学校棒多了

它帮助他有逻辑地、从根本上
来考虑日常生活中的问题
这真的很有用

当他们说要用？？？和父母？？？
我觉得？？？
所以还蛮有趣的

我喜欢
我爱玩游戏
我甚至在家里和爸爸妈妈玩

我在这儿交到了很多朋友

我真的很喜欢麦博思维实验室
因为它太有趣了

麦博思维实验室的研发团队
利用全球百余种经典的和现代的思维游戏
定期开发出新的、令人兴奋的
教学和视觉工具

我们开发和扩展了一系列
适用于各个年龄层的教科书和工作簿
以及创新的教学软件包
和很多自主使用说明
为了帮助世界各地的教学团队
采用这个方法
我们以各种方式培训和支持他们

现今，在一个互联网和电脑游戏的时代
孩子们想要一起玩的时候才去学校
而且不止是在课间休息时间
他们想要像我们孩童时那样玩耍
我有时在走廊上经过
当我透过窗户看向教室
你会发现他们真的很投入
他们很有兴趣
他们很快乐
那正是我们所希望的
他们在学校里的样子
他们可以真正学到智慧
并且这可以给他们一些生活的技能

一个孩子
一旦他有自信就会行动
一旦他有了决策和解决问题的工具
结果就会更好
事实上
全世界的教学系统都应该有这个工具

孩子们喜欢它
父母们喜欢这个课程
老师们乐在教学中
所以它处处适用

麦博思维实验室太有趣了

好了
我们谈论了思维游戏
在教学过程中的独特意义
也了解了这群利用这些游戏
开发出一种独一无二的教学方式的人
我发现它十分迷人
正如哲学家柏拉图总结的一样
孩子们不应该从错误中学习
而是从游戏中

教育是儿童的游戏
