the art of playing
Bryan Tanaman

Ah playing is such fun
As the author George Bernard Shaw once said: you don’t stop playing because you are old, you grow old because you stop playing.
We all know that children love to play, and not only children.
During childhood and adolescence, the brain and ???? just get the most significant development.
Since the dawn of history, people acknowledged this fact using games to sharpen children’s mind and skills which they can do with the real life situation.
Teachers would draw lines in the sand and their pupils will play pebbles.
Families will spend long evenings around the table absorbed in the pleasure and challenge of playing games.
Generals learn battles’ strategies through playing chess.
And Japanese SAMURAI understood the importance of mind games
and adopting the game Go as one of the seven most important martial arts.
A great deal of knowledge has been lost since then and lifestyle have changed.

violent action games, extreme video clips and hours spent in front of computer have  replaced the experience of sitting in company around the game’s table.
Where is the toll?? ever persevering together in this? 
A sad reality indeed.
But apparently not all our hope is lost.
Would you believe that currently more than two million children in thirty countries around the world play games, doing lessons in class and with the teacher’s permission
 
One of the current trends in education is to teach children how to think.
The mind lab method promotes development thought in a very unique manner through play.
“My favorite game in mind lab is ... knew in Look out？？？, this game helps me to solve the problems.”

So this is what it looks like. Interesting, isn’t it? But what’s the method behind it?

At the heart of the method is the notion that children’s experience while playing will be both enjoyable and fascinating, so that they would be more and more motivated to engage in what end up in depth learning.

The learning process actually involves three primary stages:
In the first stage, the children learn games and play them in teams.
This is the stage in which the teacher enters the picture and they actually provide them with the toolbox for implementing thought strategy and thought concepts.

“Very good, so now you know that’s her plan. The question is can you do anything to prevent it.”

In the second stage, the children and the teacher discuss together what they’ve managed to learn through the game itself and they apply the models to the lessons learned.

The core of the system is the models and every model has its implications, from the game into the life itself.
when they group all my pieces together and i advance them on the board as one group rather than individually, then other groups they have much more power.
In this way i have a lot more options.
 
Could one bird fly across the ocean on their own?
eh no, i don’t think so.
but if they work together, they can, can’t they?

in the third step
we will teach the children how to make a transposition, a transposition of what they’ve learned through play models to real life.
when they actually encounter challenges and situations will be able to perform better through the models.

i want to teach you a decision making model
this model is intended for analyzing the environment in a better manner when facing rivals
for example, when you get upset to a kid or when someone makes you mad 
red means you should calm down now or you stop and think.

very good, well done
for example, if i would play football outside and smaller kids were playing and kick the ball, which would then hit my head 
I should first calm down, stop and examine what their goal was
why do they do this
examine the environment 
after examining the environment 
i prepare to act
if i see that it is not intentional
i calm down as you said 
and now i am walking after having a few seconds to think things over.

the mind lab method is the bridge that connects the world of games with the real world
the method includes the educational programs that are given toward children and teenagers age 4 to 16
the program in cooperate with a wide range of courses
that are aimed at improving upon children’s thinking skills by addressing cognitive, social and emotional issues
 
i like the games because it is completely different to others games you can play
they teach things which i find fun

all this is fine
There is no doubt that for the children playing is fun 
but who says it works?
how do we know that the method is really effective?
and manages to influence children’s mental behavioral patterns?

... leading researchers from..perstitul universities around the world had brought by professor Donald Green of Yale University in the United States have examined this

with that three and a half years i’ve conducted to the serials of scientific evaluations of the mind lab curriculum
in the treatment group
children receive the mind lab curriculum whereby the play with games but learn broader lessons about the applicability of the strategic concepts to other arrays of life
and in the control group
they simply play with games 
and what we find is a significant improvement in the treatment group

when these children were tested in math and verbal ability
it was found that the treatment group significantly outperform to the control group

the more exposure children have to the mind lab curriculum, the more intensively it is implemented, the best they do
and in a field where real interventions the work are???
I’m quite pleased to report that this is one of those innovations that does work
it works to a high standard of scientific equability  

i think it is time to get to know the people behind the vision
 
the development team whose members have being working together for thirteen years is made of educators from a variety of specializations and people from the world of games, including players of chess, Go and bridge

i was a very poor math student when i was a kid
which was kind of surprising with the fact that i was very strong at games, especially chess

we created this company on the bases of our childhood experiences
when we played this as kids and later on the students
we learned a lot
it was actually this understanding that playing is so helpful that made us create this company

the game helped me a lot to overcome the problem i had in school 
and that gave me a lot of motivation to try and help other kids with the same problem

Matan Toledo, a twelve year old from ??? studied in six grade
until fifth grade 
he was considered as a weak student
he was not good in physics or math  
and his capabilities were considered bellow average
because of this, he suffered from low self esteem 
and his social relation suffered  

i achieve the best scores in thinking games
he came with this news I won in class 
in the entire grade and the entire school
 
the teachers in school discovered another side to his personality
...... the achievement tease motivate to study

i improved in subjects like Bible studies, history, geography

our advantages is that we have created the program based on a few experiences with kids rather than a few radical plan to be implemented later on

it was evident that the self confident he started to display and even in the way his friends related to him 

and then suddenly i felt better about myself
like i could really be a winner

There is no doubt that this is a success story 
the method is really proving itself in thousands of schools 
across thirty countries
on all five continents
and every three weeks 
another country joins them

in the last three years i’ve been visiting over twenty countries 
and very quickly i came to the conclusion that people are people and kids are kids
They behave and respond to the program pretty much the same way
whether they are from Brazil, Australia or Japan 

it taught me so much 
And i felt so much better than school

So it’s helping him to think logically basically into everyday problems in life 
and it really is helping out
 
when they talk about using ..???.against parents
i think it is better around..
so it is some kind of fun

eh, i love i love games
and i even play with my mom and dad at home

and i’ve make a lot of friends here

i really like the mind lab games because it was like so much fun

the research in development team of mind lab routinely create new and exciting educational and visual tools 
use over one hundred thinking games
both modern and classic from all over the world

we developed and extended serials of textbooks and workbooks for all age groups
as well as innovated educational software packages and many demonstration of self use utility
to help educational team around the world employ the method
we train them and support them all the way

nowadays in the age of the internet and computer games 
children get to school when they want to play together 
and not just during the break
they want to play together the way we did as the kids

what i do is i walk along the corridors sometimes when i look through the windows 
and you see that they are really engaged, they are interested
and they are very happy 
that is what we want them to be at the school 
they can really gain from it intellectually and this is go to give them some skills for life
 
a kid, once he has self-confident will act 
once he has the decision making 
and problem-solving tools 
the products will be better 
in fact educational systems throughout the world should have this tool 

the kids love it 
parents love the program
teachers enjoy when they teach it
and that ends in a completely universal 

Mind lab is so fun

well we discuss the unique significance of mind games on the educational process 
and we have discovered the group people
who develop a unique educational process based on these games 
i found it fascinating 
as the philosophy Plato sum it up precisely:
Not by fault shall the children learn 
but by play 


education is child’s play
